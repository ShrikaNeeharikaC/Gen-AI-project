Hermes – CI/CD Analyzer
Project Overview

Hermes is a Generative AI–powered CI/CD log analyzer that automates the detection of pipeline failures, pinpoints root causes, and provides intelligent remediation suggestions. It integrates seamlessly into CI/CD pipelines to reduce downtime, speed up debugging, and improve software delivery efficiency.

 Problem Statement

Modern software teams rely heavily on CI/CD pipelines for code integration, testing, and deployment.

Manual log analysis is time-consuming and requires expert DevOps knowledge.

Slow debugging delays releases, increases downtime, and impacts product quality.

 Solution

Hermes ingests CI/CD logs and leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to:

Detect failures and identify root causes.

Suggest automated fixes or rollback actions.

Provide real-time dashboards for pipeline visibility.

Continuously learn from user feedback to improve accuracy.

 Key Benefits

 60% Reduction in Root Cause Analysis time

 $150K Annual Savings in debugging & downtime costs

 40% Faster MTTR (Mean Time to Recovery)

35% Increase in Deployment Frequency

100% Visibility across CI/CD tools

 10x Faster Onboarding for new developers

Storage: Elasticsearch for efficient vector storage & retrieval.

LLM Engine: Processes queries, analyzes logs, and provides root cause + fix suggestions.

Tech Stack

Frontend: Streamlit, ReactJS, Vanilla JS Graphs

Backend: Python, Node.js

Database: Elasticsearch

AI Models: OpenAI GPT APIs, LLaMA 3.1

Monitoring: Langfuse (LLMOps – tracing, evaluation, observability)
